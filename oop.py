# **Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class!** üèóÔ∏è
# Create a class representing anything you like (a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero!).
# Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life!
# Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.
# Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.

# **Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge! üé≠**

# Create a program that includes animals or vehicles with the same action (like move()). However, make each class define move() 
# differently (for example, Car.move() prints "Driving" üöó, while Plane.move() prints "Flying" ‚úàÔ∏è).


class TheBoys:
    # During class definition, no brackets
    # constructor - allows each instance of the class to have unique atributes

        # unique attributes
        self.name = name
        self.role = role

    def capture_supe(self, supe_name):
